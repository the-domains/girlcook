Amish Simplicity

A simple yard with a garden filled with the start of the new season--big curled leaves iverdlowing. An Amish Mom was bent over the crops while her three children played, their dark blue and black clothes and bonnets hugging ruddy faces.

The littlest boy presented a bright yellow dandelion to my sister crumpled in his little fat fist and playfully running after her. They laughed with abandon. I hoped that this small tender exchange would carve his opinion of the strange visitors for the rest of his days.

Before leaving we went to the garden where the Mom pulled giant leaves attached to long red stems---Rhubarb!!! Her oldest son pulled out a bone handled knife and quickly lopped off the poisonous leaves.

We treated from the sunshine saying our goodbyes. What will we bake with this beautiful fresh bounty? Could the sweetness ever match our experience that day?
